Some claim stewardship over the fleshy realms that birth new demons, while others guard sites of particular significance deep in the plane's secret reaches. Often, a nalfeshnee's realm in the Abyss surpasses the strength and size of the largest of mortal kingdoms, for nalfeshnees display a singular gift for managing and ordering the chaos of the Abyss. Mortal summoners often seek them out for their unparalleled yet mad intellects, ever taking care to comb through bargains with such demons for hidden and unwanted consequences, for there is little a nalfeshnee will agree to do that does not, in some sinister way, advance the needs and desires of the Abyss.</p>",
